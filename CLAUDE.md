This repository is a **Lex** project. Lex is not Python with weird
syntax; it is a typed-effect language with a content-addressed AST and
an attestation graph. Treat the rules in this file as part of the task
brief.

## Mandatory reading before writing code

Run these in order:

```sh
lex --version                  # confirm Lex is installed; if missing, see below
lex agent-guidelines           # authoritative idiom rules — read in full
lex skill                      # CLI surface + exit codes (ACLI)
```

`lex agent-guidelines` is the prescriptive contract for this project.
Do not write code until you have read it. The rules are numbered and
stable; this CLAUDE.md exists only to point you at them and add
project-specific overrides.

## The discipline summary

The full rules live in `lex agent-guidelines`. The four that matter
most when you're tempted to skip them:

1. **Narrow effects, always.** `fn foo() -> [fs_write("/tmp/x")] T`,
   not `[fs_write]`, not `[fs_write, fs_read, io]`. If the type checker
   rejects, narrow the **body**, not the signature.
2. **Repair, don't regenerate.** When `lex check` fails, run
   `lex --output json check` to get the structured error, then
   `lex repair --apply --transform '<suggested_transform>'`. Only
   regenerate after two failed repair attempts.
3. **`examples {}` blocks on every pure fn.** They're part of the
   SigId and run at `lex check` time — free regression tests with no
   `tests/` boilerplate.
4. **Use the stdlib.** `std.crypto` not hand-rolled crypto, `std.conc`
   not threads, `std.sql` not string-concat SQL, `std.regex` not
   manual scanners. Reach for raw bytes only after checking the
   stdlib index.

## The loop

Every change goes through the same four steps. **Do not claim a task
done before all four are green.**

```sh
lex check --strict src/        # type-check with extra lints
lex fmt --check src/ tests/    # formatting (must be canonical)
lex test                        # all tests/test_*.lex files
lex ci                          # umbrella: same as the above + pkg install
```

If `lex check` fails, do **not** broaden the effect signature to
make it pass. Investigate the body. See `lex agent-guidelines` § 1.2.

## When in doubt

```sh
lex agent-guidelines        # the rules
lex skill                   # the CLI surface
lex --output json check <file>   # structured errors with rule_tag + suggested_transform
lex blame <fn> --with-evidence   # what attestations already cover this fn
```

Lex toolchain version pinned by this project: see `lex.toml` /
`.github/workflows/lex.yml`. If `lex --version` reports a different
version locally, install the pinned one from
<https://github.com/alpibrusl/lex-lang/releases> before continuing.

## Project-specific overrides — lex-orm

- **Public surface lives in `src/query.lex`.** Everything else is
  internal; don't expose new helpers without adding them to the
  module's public re-export list.
- **All DB calls run under `[sql]`.** Per AGENTS rule §3.2, use
  `sql.query` / `sql.execute` / `sql.exec` with parameterised
  arguments — never `str.concat` SQL.
- **`SqlError` shape (since lex 0.9.2):** `{ message :: Str, code ::
  Option[Str], detail :: Option[Str] }`. Match-unwrap `code` and
  `detail` rather than reading them as bare `Str`.
- **`run_*` helpers wrap `sql.*` with a consistent `Result[T,
  DbError]` shape.** Add new wrappers in pairs (`run_X` + matching
  unit-test in `tests/test_query.lex`).
